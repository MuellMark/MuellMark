# Howdy! ðŸ¤ 

I'm <b> Mark Mueller</b>, an undergraduate student enrolled at Southwestern University. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science, and I am set to graduate in May of 2024. Below is an overview of my experience using GitHub, but for a more in depth look into my work, check out my LinkedIn: [![Linkedin: Mark Mueller](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MarkMueller-blue?style=flat-square&logo=Linkedin&logoColor=white&link=[https://www.linkedin.com/in/muellermark2002/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muellermark2002/))](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muellermark2002/)

## About Me

I am currently interning with Wridz, an up-and-coming ride-share company as a software developer. On top of general troubleshooting, I've been working on adding in language support into their application. From there I'll also be refining their log systems to make it easier to parse through while troubleshooting.

I have co-authored 2 academic papers:
 - **[Evolving Flying Machines in Minecraft Using Quality Diversity](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3583131.3590352)**
 - **[Prioritizing Self, Team, or Job: Trends in Sincerity in Cooperative Polls](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16538-2_4)**

On top of these I'm in the process of conducting more research in the Theoretical Math and Operations Research sectors. I've refined algorithms and visualized DDM-Labeled graphs, which can be found **[HERE](https://github.com/MuellMark/DDMGraphLabelingGenerator)**, or in the repository found below. I'm also working on creating a program to schedule university courses using PyGLPK (a Python implementation of GLPK). More information on this is to come!

On top of all of my research, I also:
- Work at the IT Department on my campus ðŸ–¥
- Am the president of Southwestern Universityâ€™s Computer Science Club ðŸ‘¾
- Am a member of 2 other honor societies ðŸŽ“
- Have a cumulative GPA of 4.0 ðŸ¤“
- Can be reached at this email: muemark10@gmail.com ðŸ“§
