# Howdy! ðŸ¤ 

I'm <b> Mark Mueller</b>, a Systems Developer at Southwestern University. Igraduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in May of 2024. Below is an overview of my experience using GitHub, but for a more in depth look into my work, check out my LinkedIn: [![Linkedin: Mark Mueller](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MarkMueller-blue?style=flat-square&logo=Linkedin&logoColor=white&link=[https://www.linkedin.com/in/muellermark2002/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muellermark2002/))](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muellermark2002/)

## About Me

I recently started the Systems Developer Position at Southwstern, but previously I interned with Wridz, an up-and-coming ride-share company as a software developer. While there, I added in language support to their application, in addition to addinf luxury and electric vehicles as options. I also worked to help streamline their logging system.

I have co-authored 3 academic papers:
 - **[Evolving Flying Machines in Minecraft Using Quality Diversity](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3583131.3590352)**
 - **[Prioritizing Self, Team, or Job: Trends in Sincerity in Cooperative Polls](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16538-2_4)**
 - **[Course Scheduling Made Easier: A User-Friendly Web-Based Timetabling Tool Using PyGLPK](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-71315-6_26)**

On top of these I'm in the process of conducting more research in the Theoretical Math and Operations Research sectors. I've refined algorithms and visualized DDM-Labeled graphs, which can be found **[HERE](https://github.com/MuellMark/DDMGraphLabelingGenerator)**, or in the repository found below. 

For my capstone project, I also collaborated with a small team to create course scheduling website that allows department chairs to create schedules. This functions by calling a python script that creates a linear program that is solved by PyGPLK and is then displayed on the site where users can then make edits. That repo can be found **[HERE](https://github.com/MuellMark/Course-Scheduler)**, or in the repository found below.
